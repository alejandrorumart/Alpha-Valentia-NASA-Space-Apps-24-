# Alpha-Valentia-NASA-Space-Apps-24-

We are a group of 6 physics students that have decided to embark in one of the Nasa Space Apps Challenge 2024.
In this code repository we present our solution to the Exosky! challenge.
So far, our solution has 18 exoplanets from which we can explore the night sky.
The aim of the project is to create a divulgative and educating tool for middle school students that explains astronomy concepts related to constellations and stars.

Bear in mind that you need to install ursina package to make the app run.
